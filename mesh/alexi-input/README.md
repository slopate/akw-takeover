# Earthquake Input

## Enclosure

I set out to create an object that supplies tactile and open-ended interaction. I constructed a mountain range out of a few pieces of wood, and attached a vibration sensor to the inside of the enclosure. When rubbed, shaken, or tapped, the sensor activates and sends a signal over the network.

The wiring for this sensor is very straightforward. The vibration sensor takes power and ground from the ESP, and uses the single signal pin of 34 (read in analog).
